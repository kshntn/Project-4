# Project-4 Music App

The goal of this project is to design and layout a music playing app that displays the list of available songs in a ListView, navigates to a details screen of the currently playing song, and uses explicit intents to navigate around the app. Used OnclickListeners to add behaviors to buttons. Used Arraylist and populated ListView using ArrayAdapter.


The app created presents user with a list of languages and when one of them is selected, a list of songs of that language are displayed.

This is not a full-fledged music app. The purpose of the project was to create an app using intent to navigate between screens.
